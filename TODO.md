## Migrate remote (repo) cached skills from ~/.cache/skill-select to ~/.cache/skill (2026-07-10)

**Problem:** Remote (repo) cached skills are currently downloaded and stored in
`~/.cache/skill-select/` and `~/.cache/skill-select/catalog/`
(`skills/workspace-config/scripts/skill:490`). By contrast, other skill
utilities and metadata reside under `~/.cache/skill/`. Having remote cache
storage split across `~/.cache/skill-select` and `~/.cache/skill` creates
inconsistent paths for developers and automation scripts.

**Goal:** Remote GitHub skill caches and catalog indexes live under
`~/.cache/skill/` (e.g., `~/.cache/skill/remotes/` or `~/.cache/skill/catalog/`)
rather than `~/.cache/skill-select/`, establishing a single consistent cache
root for all `skill` operations.

**Criteria:** Zero occurrences of `skill-select` across
`skills/workspace-config/` scripts and tests, and running
`skill update --catalog` populates `~/.cache/skill/` without creating a
`~/.cache/skill-select/` directory.

**Sketch:** Update `get_cache_base()` and `get_catalog_dir()` in
`skills/workspace-config/scripts/skill`
(`skills/workspace-config/scripts/skill:490`) to target `~/.cache/skill/`.
Update corresponding test assertions in `test-skill` and `test-envrc` that
assert `~/.cache/skill-select`. A one-time migration or cleanup for existing
`~/.cache/skill-select/` directories may be helpful to avoid leaving orphaned
caches on developer workstations.

**Constraints:** No behavior changes to skill resolution or caching logic; path
relocation only.

## Fix stale `# Tests:` pointers in scripts and tests (2026-07-09)

**Problem:** `# Tests:` comments predate the flat, co-located test layout now
documented in `tests/README.md` and were never migrated. An audit (2026-07-09)
found 22 of 26 pointers stale: they name old directory-style paths that no
longer exist — root-level `tests/video-index/` where the test now lives at
`tests/test-video-index` (`bin/video-index:6`), or `tests/pacioli/` where it
moved to `skills/agent-tools/tests/test-pacioli`
(`skills/agent-tools/scripts/pacioli:6`). Both the scripts under test and the
test files themselves carry stale pointers.

**Goal:** Every `# Tests:` comment points at a path that exists, matching the
convention in `tests/README.md` ("Link back from the script"). The comment
exists so tests are discoverable via `grep '# Tests:'`; a pointer to a missing
path defeats that.

**Criteria:** This audit reports zero stale entries:

```bash
grep -rn '^# Tests:' bin skills/*/scripts skills/*/tests tests --no-messages \
  | sed 's/:[0-9]*:# Tests: */\t/' \
  | awk -F'\t' '{ if (system("test -e \"" $2 "\"")) print "STALE", $1, "->", $2 }'
```

**Sketch:** A mechanical find/replace per pointer. One open call: test files
carrying their own `# Tests:` comment (e.g. `tests/test-git-setup:3`) —
`tests/README.md` only asks for the comment on the script under test, so either
make these self-referential (as `tests/test-git-hooks-multiplexer` already is)
or drop them.

**Constraints:** Comment-only edits; no behavior changes.

## Standardize concise help on missing required arguments (2026-07-09)

**Problem:** `cli-tools.md` already states the rule (adopted from clig.dev): a
tool invoked without required arguments should print a brief description, one or
two examples, and a pointer to `--help` — not full help text, and not only "Try
--help". No script was changed to implement it when `-h` support was added (PR
#134), because it's a per-script judgment call, not a mechanical find/replace. A
grep audit of `bin/` and `skills/*/scripts/` (2026-07-09) found at least three
different existing behaviors for missing required arguments, all still live:

1. **Full help text, exit 1** — e.g. `usage 1 >&2` in `bin/csv-query:28` and
   `bin/image-mask-circular:38`. Dumps everything (all examples, every flag) to
   stderr for a simple "you forgot an argument" error.
1. **Bare error, no pointer to `--help`** — e.g.
   `echo "$(basename "$0"): missing operand" >&2; exit 1` in
   `bin/macos-bootout:40`. Correct exit code, but no example and no "Try
   '--help'" pointer, which even the outgoing standard's GNU-style error
   convention wanted.
1. **No args treated as an implicit help request, exit 0** — e.g.
   `if [[ "$1" == "--help" || "$1" == "-h" || -z "$1" ]]; then usage; fi` in
   `skills/adb/scripts/adb-demo:40` and `skills/adb/scripts/adb-fontscale`. This
   is clig.dev's "bare complex command shows help" allowance, but these are
   simple single-action tools (Appendix A patterns), not `git`-style subcommand
   tools — treating missing-args as a request for help (exit 0) instead of a
   usage error (exit >0) breaks scripting (`tool; echo $?` can't distinguish
   "ran fine" from "forgot an argument").

**Goal:** One consistent behavior for simple (non-subcommand) tools invoked
without a required positional argument: print a short usage line, one example,
and a pointer to `--help`/`-h` to stderr, then exit `1` — never the full help
text, never a bare error with no example, never exit `0`. Complex subcommand
tools (the `kubectl`-style and Manager-pattern tools covered by `cli-tools.md`'s
Appendix A) are explicitly out of scope here: clig.dev's bare-command-shows-help
allowance is for them, and `git-hooks-multiplexer`, `skill`, `jetpack`, etc.
already implement it deliberately.

**Criteria:** `shell.md` documents a short concise-usage pattern (e.g. a
`usage_short()` helper or an inline `die_usage`-style one-liner, whichever reads
more like the rest of the file) developers can drop into the `if [[ $# -lt N ]]`
preamble. Every simple-pattern script in `bin/` and `skills/*/scripts/` that
currently does pattern 1, 2, or 3 above for a *required* positional argument is
converted to the new behavior and exits `1`. `shellcheck`/`shfmt` clean;
existing test suites still pass (a few tests likely assert today's
exit-0-on-no-args or full-help-dump behavior and will need updating alongside
the scripts they cover).

**Sketch:** Grep for `usage 1 >&2`, `missing operand`, and
`-z "\$1"[^]]*--help\|--help[^]]*-z "\$1"` across `bin/` and `skills/*/scripts/`
to enumerate the full set (the three examples above are a starting sample, not
the complete list). Decide per script whether the first positional argument is
actually required — some of the `-z "$1"` tools may have a legitimate zero-arg
default behavior rather than a missing required argument, in which case they're
out of scope and should be left alone rather than forced into a usage error.

**Constraints:** No behavior change for scripts whose missing-argument case is
genuinely a valid default (not an error). Keep bash 3.2 compatibility. Don't
touch the complex subcommand tools' bare-invocation-shows-help behavior.
