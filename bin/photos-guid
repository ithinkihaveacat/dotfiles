Usage: $(basename "$0") DIRECTORY

Calculates a unique GUID from image data and embeds it into JPEGs and matching
RAW files in the specified directory.

This makes it easy to find the RAW file associated with a JPG using Spotlight,
even if the image has been edited.

Arguments:
  DIRECTORY   The directory containing photos to process.

Options:
  --help      Display this help message and exit

Examples:
  $(basename "$0") .

Notes:
  To find a RAW file given a JPG (e.g., photo.jpg):
    mdfind (mdls -r -name kMDItemFinderComment photo.jpg)

  To recover just the GUID:
    mdls -name kMDItemFinderComment photo.jpg
    exiftool -ImageUniqueID photo.jpg
EOF
  exit 0

    # Ideally we'd write the GUID to the EXIF, and macOS would index that field.
    # However, I can't find a suitable field. (kMDItemIdentifier looks pretty
    # promising, but it doesn't seem to correspond to any EXIF field.) So,
    # instead we write the GUID to both the ImageUniqueID EXIF field (in the
    # file) *and* macOS's MDItemFinderComment field (in the file's metadata, on
    # macOS only). This does expose the GUID to the Finder, but it is indexed by
    # Spotlight.

    # At this point, it's possible for the actual kMDItemFinderComment as
    # received from Spotlight to be correct, but when it's queried again from
    # the command-line, it's unchanged! I don't know why this happens. (Finder
    # will show the expected value.) The fix seems to be to just run mdimport on
    # the affected files, but it's difficult to do this from the script itself.
