# Calculates a GUID from the image data (not metadata) of the JPG, embeds it
# into the JPG, and copies it into all other files that share the same name
# (e.g. RAW) files.

# This should make it possible/easy to find the RAW file associated with a JPG,
# since they will have the same GUID, and the GUID is not changed even if the
# image is edited. At least that's the idea.

# Process to find a RAW, given the JPG (photo.jpg):
#
# $ mdfind (mdls -r -name kMDItemFinderComment DSCF5339.JPG)
# /Users/mjs/Desktop/105_FUJI/DSCF5339.JPG
# /Users/mjs/Desktop/105_FUJI/DSCF5339.RAF
#
# Recover just the GUID:
#
# $ mdls -name kMDItemFinderComment DSCF5339.JPG
# kMDItemFinderComment = "a42a638a1d24c573b04cb565d4cc3e64439824cec2ad0378fe34389c993400f6"
#
# Or, if Finder metadata lost:
#
# $ exiftool -ImageUniqueID DSCF5339.JPG
# Image Unique ID                 : a42a638a1d24c573b04cb565d4cc3e64439824cec2ad0378fe34389c993400f6

# Useful commands, for debugging and otherwise

    # promising, but it doesn't seem to correspond to any EXIF field.) So,
    # instead we write the GUID to both the ImageUniqueID EXIF field (in the
    # file) *and* macOS's MDItemFinderComment field (in the file's metadata, on
    # macOS only). This does expose the GUID to the Finder, but it is indexed by
    # Spotlight.
