# Psychology expert: The No. 1 way to respond to a manipulator—it ‘shifts the power in your favor’


Manipulation doesn’t always look dramatic or explosive. It could be a loaded
comment in a meeting, a subtle guilt trip in an email, or a casual remark that
leaves you questioning yourself long after the conversation ends.

What makes manipulators effective is their ability to influence how you feel.
[Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886925004477)
on social influence and coercive control shows that manipulators aim for
emotional impact: the drop in your confidence, the spike in your anxiety, the
moment you start defending instead of deciding.

In my decade advising Fortune 500 companies as a behavioral researcher, I’ve
seen this pattern at every level: the person who controls the emotional tone
often controls the direction of the interaction.

The most powerful response to a manipulator isn’t to confront them. This often
backfires, triggering gaslighting, denial, or escalation. Here’s a simple
strategy I teach to help you “CUT” through manipulation.

## C: Control your emotions

When your nervous system spikes, your thinking narrows and your behavior becomes
easier to steer.
[Studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666354624000449)
on emotional regulation show that staying physiologically calm preserves
decision quality under pressure. Slow your breath. Lower your voice. Buy
yourself a few seconds before responding.

**Instead of reacting with:**

- Snapping or raising your voice: “Why are you saying that? That’s not true!”
- Over-explaining or defending yourself: “Actually, I did do \[X\], and here’s
  why…”
- Appeasing or over-committing when it’s unreasonable: “Okay, I’ll handle it.”
- Getting defensive or anxious: internal panic, self-doubt, or visible
  agitation.

**Try responding with:**

- Neutral acknowledgment: “Noted.”
- Redirect to facts or agenda: “Let’s focus on the next step.”
- Brief, calm clarification if necessary: “I understood it differently; here’s
  what I did.”
- Pause and buy time: a slow breath, or a moment to compose your response before
  engaging.

By staying neutral in your responses, you remove the emotional fuel that
manipulators rely on and shift the interaction back into your control.

## U: Unfazed appearance

Even when your heart is racing, how you show up matters. A relaxed posture,
relaxed facial expression, and steady verbal pace signal that there’s nothing to
hook into.

[Research](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.624177/full)
on status dynamics and dominance signaling shows that the least reactive person
is often seen as the most powerful. Staying unfazed tells the manipulator: Your
tactics aren’t working on me.

## T: Turn off engagement

This is where most people slip. They explain, defend, justify, and try to be
understood. But feeding the emotional layer is exactly what keeps manipulation
alive. Instead, refocus on facts, boundaries, or the task at hand. Pay attention
only to what you can control.

Together, these three moves cut off the oxygen from the interaction. You’re no
longer a lever that can be pulled. Over time, that shifts the power in your
favor.

The most powerful response is far more destabilizing to the manipulator’s
strategy: emotional non-cooperation. Calmly, neutrally, and consistently
refusing to feed the emotional leverage, you take away the fuel that sustains
their behavior. When emotional leverage disappears, the manipulation often
stops.
