Dumps the state of the RpcTracker from the Wearable Service.

This script extracts the section of the 'dumpsys wearableservice' output
that tracks remote procedure calls (RPCs) made using the MessageClient.
It shows which paths are being called and how often.

Options:
  --help      Display this help message and exit

Environment:
  ANDROID_SERIAL  Serial number of device to connect to (see 'adb devices -l').
                  To target a specific device, use:
                    env ANDROID_SERIAL=<serial> $(basename "$0")

Examples:
  # Show all RPC tracker information
  $(basename "$0")

  # Find information about a specific RPC path
  $(basename "$0") | grep "/my_app/rpc_path"
EOF
  exit 0
