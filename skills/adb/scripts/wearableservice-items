that are synchronized between the watch and phone.

  --help      Display this help message and exit

Environment:
  ANDROID_SERIAL  Serial number of device to connect to (see 'adb devices -l').
                  To target a specific device, use:
                    env ANDROID_SERIAL=<serial> $(basename "$0")

Examples:
  # Show all data service information
  $(basename "$0")

  # Find information about a specific data item
  $(basename "$0") | grep "my_app/data_item"
EOF
  exit 0
