Dumps the state of the NodeService from the Wearable Service.

This script extracts the section of the 'dumpsys wearableservice' output
that deals with the connected nodes (devices) in the Wear OS network.
It shows information about each node, such as its ID, name, and whether
it is the local device.

Options:
  --help      Display this help message and exit

Environment:
  ANDROID_SERIAL  Serial number of device to connect to (see 'adb devices -l').
                  To target a specific device, use:
                    env ANDROID_SERIAL=<serial> $(basename "$0")

Examples:
  # Show all node service information
  $(basename "$0")
EOF
  exit 0
}
